title: "Comparing two confidence intervals."
description: |
  Using one-sample confidence intervals on the mean to decide if there's good evidence that two means are different. Statistical experts know to use the two-sample t-test for such  problems, but best to  build up intuition first and then add  mathematical refinements  later. And, you'll  be able to see for yourself whether the refinements have any  practical impact.
